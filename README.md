++Summary
This is a programming exercise provided my Megaport as part
of their hiring process. It is a simple command line application
which sorts an input file of names by the last name and then the
first name. The application takes one argument which is the file
to be sorted and creates an output file with the names sorted with the
suffix -sorted. An example usage would be as follows.

./sort.sh <input_file>

++Testing
To run tests you will need an updated version of JUnit, to run them utilise
the compiled classes in the out/test/MegaportExercise/com/megaport/test
directory and run them with the JUnit jar file. (Would reccomend utilising
and IDE for this).

++Dependencies
SDK - open-jdk-17.0.1
JUnit - 5.8.1
